# Blender Practice Project

This project is a personal Blender practice workspace focused on improving my skills with **lighting**, **visual effects**, and **sculpting**.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is experimentation and learning rather than producing a finished asset or scene. I use it to explore how different lighting setups affect mood, depth, and realism, as well as to practice sculpting techniques and basic effects workflows.

## Areas of Focus
- Lighting setups (key, fill, rim, environmental lighting)
- Material interaction with light
- Visual effects and atmosphere
- Sculpting forms and surface detail
- General Blender workflow improvement

## Notes
- This project is iterative and may change frequently.
- Assets and scenes may be rough, incomplete, or experimental.
- The focus is on learning and exploration rather than polish.
